# SiefertMatrix_PD_Notation

The goal of this project is to calculate the Siefert Matrix of a knot using a given 
PD Notation of the knot. This file will contain the steps I took to calculate the Siefert Matrix 
and the knot invarient determinent, as well as subsections of code for these steps.

Given: Knot in PD_Notation  , Output: Siefert Matrix and the determinent of the knot.
